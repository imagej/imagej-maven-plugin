**This Maven plugin is deprecated since the _copy-jars_ goal has been migrated to [`scijava-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-maven-plugin). We have made sure to keep backward compatibility with `imagej.*` properties, but recommend to replace them with `scijava.*` properties when switching to `scijava-maven-plugin`.**

**If your project has at least `pom-scijava:24.0.0` as parent, `scijava-maven-plugin` has been made the default Maven plugin for handling installation of SciJava and ImageJ plugins.**
